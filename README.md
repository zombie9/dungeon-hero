## *Workflow*

![Alt text](/static/images/trello_board.png?raw=true "trello_board") <br>

* As a team we regularly had two stand-ups (one in the morning and a shorter one after the lunch break) to help us focus on the daily priorities, do a bit of brainstorming on new possible features to implement, update our Trello board to assign a degree of complexity to every task as well as the people responsible for that task.
* We split our work in sprints, each of them with a duration of two days, assigning to each sprint a new definition of MVP and then discussing new additions on the go with quick stand-ups.
* At the end of each sprint we had a retrospective to discuss our progresses, the overall state of the project and to share general thoughts and feelings about the project and/or the team dynamics.
* In order to have a clear idea of the work we had to do we regularly updated the above mentioned Trello board.

## *Technologies*

<img src="/static/images/js.png" width="120" height="60"><img src="/static/images/jquery.png" width="100" height="70"><img src="/static/images/jasmine.png" width="160" height="110"><img src="/static/images/istanbul.png" width="90" height="60"><img src="/static/images/eslint.png" width="160" height="90"><img src="/static/images/travis 2.png" width="120" height="80">

* Almost 90% of our code has been written in vanilla <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a> alongside with some HTML5 and CSS for the GUI (graphic user interface).
* We used <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> (a JavaScript library) in order to make the game logic communicating with the user inputs (through the GUI).
* To test our app we used <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> (open source testing framework for JavaScript).
* To check our test coverage we used <a href="https://istanbul.js.org/">Istanbul</a> (a Node.js module) and <a href="https://coveralls.io/">Coverall.io</a> (a website hosting GitHub repositories and checking for your coverage percentage after every merge).
* We also used <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> as linter (a tool to analyze your code to flag bugs and stylistic errors).
* To achieve continuous integration we used <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>, a hosted service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub. Its main purpose is to avoid untested and/or buggy branches to be merged into the Master branch.
